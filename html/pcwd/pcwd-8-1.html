                    <span>Practical Significance: </span><br><br>

                    Turbidity is an important indicator of the amount of suspended sediment in water, which can have
                    many negative effects on aquatic life. The suspended sediments that cause turbidity can block
                    light to aquatic plants, smother aquatic organisms, and carty contaminants and pathogens, such
                    as lead, mercury, and bacteria. Turbidity describes the clarity of water. Suspended materials in
                    water, such as clay, silt and algae, reduce water clarity and cause turbidity. <br><br>

                    <span>Relevant Program Outcomes (POs): </span><br><br>

                    PO 1: Basic and Discipline specific knowledge: Apply knowledge of basic mathematics, science and
                    engineering fundamentals and engineering specialization to solve the chemical engineering
                    problems. <br><br>

                    PO 4: Engineering Tools, Experimentation and Testing: Apply modern engineering tools and
                    appropriate technique to conduct standard tests and measurements. <br><br>

                    <span>Practical Outcome</span><br><br>

                    To determine turbidity of water by using Naphelo turbidity meter <br><br>

                    <span>Theory</span><br><br>

                    Clarity of water is important in producing products destined for human consumption in many
                    manufacturing uses, brewer age production, food processors and treatment plants, drawing of
                    surface water supply commonly rely on coagulation, settling and filtration to ensure an
                    acceptable product. The clarity of a natural body of water is a major determinant of the
                    condition and productivity of that system. <br><br>

                    Turbidity in water is caused by suspended matter such as clay, slit, finely divided organic
                    compounds and planktons and other microscopic organisms. Turbidity is an expression of
                    suspension in the sample, optically black particles such as those of activated carbon may absorb
                    light and effectively increase turbidity measurement. <br><br>

                    The digital turbidity meter is a very accurate and stable instrument for measurement of
                    turbidity up to 100 NTU.
