                    <span>Practical Significance: </span><br><br>

                    The soda ash industry is a part of the chemical industry, which is responsible for the
                    production of sodium carbonate, calcium chloride, absorbent masses, evaporated wet salt, food
                    salt, pickling salt or salt tablets. During manufacturing of those products, strongly alkaline
                    wastewater is generated. It could be characterised by a high electrolytic conductivity and
                    concentration of ions: chlorides, sulfates, phosphates, calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium
                    and ammonium. <br><br>

                    <span>Relevant Program Outcomes (POs): </span><br><br>

                    PO 1: Basic and Discipline specific knowledge: Apply knowledge of basic mathematics, science and
                    engineering fundamentals and engineering specialization to solve the chemical engineering
                    problems. <br><br>

                    PO 4: Engineering Tools, Experimentation and Testing: Apply modern engineering tools and
                    appropriate technique to conduct standard tests and measurements. <br><br>

                    <span>Practical Outcome</span><br><br>

                    To determine the concentration of sodium in the sample.<br><br>

                    <span>Theory</span><br><br>

                    Flame photometer is an instrument with which it is possible to estimate with speed and accurate,
                    minute quantities of Na, K and Ca. The principal solution of under analysis is sprayed as a fine
                    mist to a non- luminous flame, which becomes coloured according to the characteristic's emission
                    of the metal. A very narrow band of wavelength corresponding to the element analysed by the
                    light filter and allowed to fall on a photo detector whose output is connected to an electric
                    measuring device to provide the read out, before analysing the unknown solution the system is
                    standardized with solution of known concentration. The total system consists of the following
                    units:-

                    <li>Burner unit</li>
