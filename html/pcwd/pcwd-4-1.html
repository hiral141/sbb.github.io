                    <span>Practical Significance: </span><br><br>

                    BOD is the only test that gives a measure of amount of biologically oxidizable organic matter
                    present in wastewater that can be used to determine the rate at which oxidation will occur or
                    BOD will be exerted in receiving bodies of water. It is the principal test applied to domestic
                    and industrial waste to determine strength in terms of oxygen required for stabilization. BOD is
                    the major criterion used in stream pollution control where organic loading must be restricted to
                    maintain the desired DO levels. <br><br>

                    <span>Practical Outcome</span><br><br>

                    Determine the biological oxygen demand in given water sample. <br><br>

                    <span>Theory</span><br><br>

                    The biological oxygen demand (BOD) of sewage or of polluted water is the amount of oxygen
                    required for the biological decomposition of dissolved organic matter to occur under aerobic
                    condition and at the standardized time and temperature. Usually the time us taken is taken as 5
                    days and the temperature 20 degree Celsius as per the global standard. The BOD test is among the
                    most important method in sanitary analysis to determine the polluting power, or strength of
                    sewage, industrial waste or polluted water. It serves as a measure of the amount of clean
                    diluting water required for the successful disposal of sewage by dilution. The test has its
                    widest application in measuring waste loading to treatment plants and in evaluating the
                    efficiency of such treatment systems.

                    The test consists in taking the given sample in suitable concentration in dilute water in BOD
                    bottles. Two bottles are taken for each concentration and three concentration are used for each
                    sample l. One set of bottle is incubated in a BOD incubator for 5 days at 20 degree Celsius; the
                    dissolved oxygen (initial) content (D1) in the other set of bottles will be determined
                    immediately. At the end of 5 days, the dissolved oxygen content (D2) in the incubated bottle is
                    determined.Then,
                    BOD = D1 - D2/P <br><br>

                    Where, <br>

                    P = Decimal fraction of sample used <br>
                    D1 = Dissolved oxygen of diluted sample (mg/l), immediately after preparation <br>
                    D2 = Dissolved oxygen of diluted sample (mg/l), at the end of 5 days incubation <br><br>

                    Among the three values of BOD obtained for a sample select that dilution showing the residue
                    dissolved oxygen of at least 1 mg/l and a depletion of at least 2 mg/l. If two or more dilutions
                    are showing the same conditions then select the BOD value obtained by that dilutions in which
                    the maximum dissolved oxygen depletion obtained. Waste water from sewage treatment plants often
                    contains organic materials that are decomposed by microorganisms, which use oxygen in the
                    process (the amount of oxygen consumed by these organisms is breaking down the waste is known as
                    the Biological Oxygen Demand or BOD). <br><br>
                    Objectives we accomplish from BOD <br>

                    1. To assure the quality of surface water and waste water. <br>

                    2. To establish the amount of organic matter in sample. <br>

                    3. To understand the significance of dissolved oxygen in sample.

                    As most of effluent contain large quantities of organic matter and do not contain dissolved
                    oxygen, they have to be diluted and supplied with oxygen. This is done by diluting them with
                    standard dilution water containing enough oxygen. Suitable dilution water should satisfy the
                    following requirements:

                    generally used is fresh and settled raw sewage.
