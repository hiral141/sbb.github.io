                    <span>Practical Significance: </span><br><br>

                    Particulate matter enters respiratory track during inhalation. The effects of inhaling
                    particulate matter have been widely studies in humans and animals include asthma, lung cancer,
                    cardiovascular issues, respiratory diseases, birth defects, and premature death. High volume
                    sampler is used to determine the strength of these particulate matters in surrounding air.
                    <br><br>

                    <span>Relevant Program Outcomes (POs): </span><br><br>

                    engineering fundamentals and engineering specialization to solve the chemical engineering

                    appropriate technique to conduct standard tests and measurements. <br><br>

                    <span>Practical Outcome</span><br><br>

                    Determination of particulate matter (dust particles) in ambient air.<br><br>

                    <span>Theory</span><br><br>

                    The high volume filtration method is popular for measurement of the mass concentration of
                    suspended particulates smaller than 10µm. The sampler, universally known as “hi-vol” sampler.
                    <br><br>

                    In this method, a known volume of air is sucked by a high speed blower through a fine filter and
                    the increase in weight due to the trapped particles is measured. The filter, usually made of
                    fibrous or granular material, provide a dense porous medium through which an air stream must
                    change direction in a random fashion, allowing the entrained particles to impact on the filter
                    material. <br><br>

                    A typical glass fibre filter used in the air samples has an efficiency of over 99% for the
                    particles of size 0.3µm and it is moderately effective for trapping particles of as small size
                    as 0.5µm. <br><br>

                    The sampling time is generally 24hrs and during this time over 2000m3of air is sucked through
                    the filter. The analysis is gravimetric and the particulate level is generally expressed in term
                    of µg/m3of air. <br><br>
                    <span>Experimental Set up:</span><br><br>
                    <img src="/html/img/pcwd9.png" style="height: 500px;" alt=""><br><br>
                    <b> Procedure -</b><br><br>
                    The high volume sampler is placed in the area of which the dust concentration is to be found out
                    in this apparatus as it consists of glass fiber filter paper provides with a blower having
                    capacity of 1.1 to 1.7 m3/min. The glass fiber filter is conditioned at 105 degree Celsius for 2
                    hours. The sampler is kept for collecting dust for 24 hours in normal situation. In case of high
                    dust concentration the time period is reduced to 8 hours after collecting the sample for 24
                    hours, the filter paper is again conditioned for 2 hours to compensate the effect of seasoning.
                    The filter paper is weight before and after the collection of the sample. The difference in
                    these two weight gives the amount of the dust collected in 24 hours. Determining the amount of
                    air passed in before and after the collection sample with the help of built in rotameter
                    calibration curves from the knowledge of observation about the amount of dust collected and the
                    volume of gas collected from which the quality of the dust is calculated. The concentration of
                    dust particles in microorganisms per meters can be calculated by using this relationship.
                    <br><br>
                    <b> Precautions -</b>
                <ol><br>
                    <li>Use a standard glass fiber filter paper of what man EPM 1000 which retains 0.1 micron size
                        particle of the dust </li><br>
                    <li>Conditioning of filter paper in 50 % humidity must be done before and after collecting the
                        sample.</li><br>
                    <li>Use blower with a capacity of 1.1 to 1.7 m3/ min.</li><br>
                    <li>Standard sampling time for a normal dust should be on an average of 24 hours and for highly
                        dusty area is 8 to 10 hours.</li>
                </ol><br>
                </p>
                <p style="padding-bottom:0px;">
                    <b> Calculation: </b><br><br>
                    Concentration of dust particle= gm of dust collected/volume of gas collected = _______ mg/m3
                    <br><br><br>
                    <b> Conclusion: </b><br><br>
                    It is observed that the dust concentration in the ambient air in this particular area = _______
                    mg/m3
