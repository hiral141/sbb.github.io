                    <span>Practical Significance: </span><br><br>

                    The rate of a chemical reaction is, perhaps, its most important property because it dictates  whether a reaction can occur during a lifetime. Knowing the rate law, an expression relating the  rate to the concentrations of reactants, can help a chemist adjust the reaction conditions to get a  more suitable rate. If there are two competing reactions for a single reagent, one can, knowing  the rate law, favour the exclusive formation of a single product. <br><br>

                    <span>Relevant Program Outcomes (POs): </span><br><br>

                    PO 1: Basic and Discipline specific knowledge: Apply knowledge of basic mathematics,  science and engineering fundamentals and engineering specialization to solve the chemical  engineering problems.  <br><br>

                    PO 4: Engineering Tools, Experimentation and Testing: Apply modern engineering tools  and appropriate technique to conduct standard tests and measurements.<br><br>

                    <span>Practical Outcome</span><br><br>

                    To determine the equation for the saponification of ethyl acetate. <br><br>

                    <span>Theory</span><br><br>

                    A rate equation characterizes the rate of a reaction and it's from may he either, suggested by  theoretical consideration on it may simply be the result of an empirical curve fitting procedure.  In many cases the value of the constants of the equation can only be found by experiments.  Experiments by which empirical information is obtained can be divided in to two types, the  batch or flow reactor A batch reactor is simply a container to hold the contents while they react.  The extent of reaction at various times has to be determined which could be done in number of  ways. Here it is done by the procedure of following the concentration of a given component.  The batch reactor being a simple device is adaptable to small-scale lab set up Thus it is used  mostly for obtaining homogeneous kinetic data. There can be variable batch reactor set up and  constant volume batch reactor as well. The flow reactor is primarily used in the study of kinetics  of heterogeneous reaction. There are two procedures for analysing kinetic data, they are integral  and differential methods.  <br><br>
