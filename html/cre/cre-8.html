                    When a single reactor cannot reach the desired conversion then more reactors are required to
                    reach up to that level. To enhance the con-version we can arrange the two reactors PFR &
                    CSTR in series. In this way the reactants well mixed. In an ideal plug flow reactor (PFR) there
                    is no mixing in the direction of flow and complete mixing perpendicular to the direction of flow
                    Concentration of the reactant vanes along the length of the reactor but not in the radial direction.
                    But in an ideal CSTR (that is an ideal steady state flow reactor) the contents in the reactor are
                    well mixed and have uniform composition throughout. Thus the exit stream has the same
                    composition as the fluid within the reactor <br><br>

                <b> Description - <br><br></b>
                The set-up consists of two feed tanks through which two reactants are fed to the reactors fitted in
                series. Rotameters are provided to measure the individual flow rate of chemicals. The flow rate can be
                adjusted by operating the needle valve provided on respective rotameter. The compressed air is used for
                circulation of feed. 1st is a helical coil tube type reactor made up of SS pipe. Reactants enter at
                lower end coming out of the top of coil from where it is fed to a MFR fitted with stirrer for proper
                mixing. Pressure gauge, pressure regulator, & safety valve are fitted in the air compressed line. The
                concentration of feed and the product coming out from the reactor are analysed by chemical titration.
