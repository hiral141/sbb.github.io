                    <span>Practical Significance: </span><br><br>

                    The rate of a chemical reaction is, perhaps, its most important property because it dictates
                    whether a reaction can occur during a lifetime. Knowing the rate law, an expression relating the
                    rate to the concentrations of reactants, can help a chemist adjust the reaction conditions to get a
                    more suitable rate. If there are two competing reactions for a single reagent, one can, knowing
                    the rate law, favour the exclusive formation of a single product.<br><br>

                    <span>Practical Outcome</span><br><br>

                    To find the rate equation for the reaction <br><br>

                    <span>Theory</span><br><br>

                    <p> For an irreversible uni molecular 1" order type reaction like A  Pdts., the rate equation may
                    be written as -r A=DCA/dt = k.CA or -InCA/CA0= kt. Therefore, a plot of -InCA/CA0 vs t gives a
                    straight line of slope k. The hydrolysis of methyl acetate is catalysed by H ions. Hydrochloric
                    acid merely acts as a catalyst. The course of the reaction is followed by withdrawing a definite
                    quantity of the reaction mixture after different intervals of time and titrating against a std. alkali.
                    The amount of the alkali used is equivalent to the total amount of hydrochloric acid originally
                    present and the amount of acetic acid formed in the reaction. Since the amount of HCI present
                    originally is known or can be determined by titrating against the same alkali at the
                    commencement of reaction, the amount of acetic acid formed (x) after different intervals of time(t), 
                    can be obtained. The amount of acetic acid formed at the end of the reaction is equivalent to
                    the initial concentration CA of the ester. Suppose the volumes of the std. solution of NaOH
                    required for the neutralization of 5ml of the reacting solution, at the commencement of the
                    reaction, after time t and at the end of the reaction are V0, Vt, and Va respectively. Then x the
                    amount of acetic acid formed after time t is proportional to Vt -Vo while the initial concentration
                    of the ester is proportional to V∞-V0. Therefore, CA the concentration of the ester present after
                    time t is proportional to <br> 
                    (V∞-V0) - (Vt -Vo) or V∞ - Vt.
