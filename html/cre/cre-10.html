                    Catalysts have many industrial uses, from the production of food products, biofuels,
                    pharmaceuticals, plastics, and chemicals. Most commercially produced chemicals are
                    made with the help of catalysts. Some notable reactions enhanced by catalysis include
                    production of sulfuric acid used for rust removal as well as a precursor for phosphoric
                    acid, synthesis of ammonia, petroleum refining, and limiting of vehicle emissions.
                    Because of how integral catalysis is to many industrial processes, scientific research to
                    improve catalysis will benefit many areas of our lives.

                <p>
                    We have seen that the rate of many reactions can be accelerated by catalysts. A catalyst speeds
                    up the rate of a reaction by lowering the activation energy; in addition, the catalyst is
                    regenerated in the process. Several reactions that are thermodynamically favourable in the
                    absence of a catalyst only occur at a reasonable rate when a catalyst is present. One such
                    reaction is catalytic hydrogenation, the process by which hydrogen is added across an alkene
                    C=C bond to afford the saturated alkane product. A comparison of the reaction coordinate
                    diagrams (also known as energy diagrams) for catalysed and uncatalyzed alkene hydrogenation
                    is shown in Figure 1. <br>
                    <img src="/html/img/cre-10.1.png" style="height: 350px;width: auto;" alt=""><br><br>
                    Figure 1. This graph compares the reaction coordinates for catalysed and uncatalyzed alkene
                    hydrogenation. <br><br>
                    Catalysts function by providing an alternate reaction mechanism that has a lower activation
                    energy than would be found in the absence of the catalyst. In some cases, the catalysed
                    mechanism may include additional steps, as depicted in the reaction diagrams shown in Figure
                    2. This lower activation energy results in an increase in rate as described by the Arrhenius
                    equation. Note that a catalyst decreases the activation energy for both the forward and the
                    reverse reactions and hence accelerates both the forward and the reverse reactions.
                    Consequently, the presence of a catalyst will permit a system to reach equilibrium more quickly,
                    but it has no effect on the position of the equilibrium as reflected in the value of its equilibrium
                    constant (see the later chapter on chemical equilibrium). <br>
                    <img src="/html/img/cre-10.2.png" style="height: 350px;width: auto;" alt=""><br><br>
                    Figure 2. This potential energy diagram shows the effect of a catalyst on the activation
                    energy. The catalyst provides a different reaction path with a lower activation energy. As
                    shown, the catalyzed pathway involves a two-step mechanism (note the presence of two
                    transition states) and an intermediate species (represented by the valley between the two
                    transitions states). <br><br>

                    <i style="font-size: larger;">Homogeneous Catalysts</i> <br><br>
                    A homogeneous catalyst is present in the same phase as the reactants. It interacts with a
                    reactant to form an intermediate substance, which then decomposes or reacts with another
                    reactant in one or more steps to regenerate the original catalyst and form product. <br>
                    As an important illustration of homogeneous catalysis, consider the earth's ozone layer. Ozone
                    in the upper atmosphere, which protects the earth from ultraviolet radiation, is formed when
                    oxygen molecules absorb ultraviolet light and undergo the reaction: <br>
                    <img src="/html/img/cre-10.4.png" style="height: 50px;width: auto;" alt=""><br><br>
                    Ozone is a relatively unstable molecule that decomposes to yield diatomic oxygen by the
                    reverse of this equation. This decomposition reaction is consistent with the following
                    mechanism: <br>
                    <img src="/html/img/cre-10.5.png" style="height: 60px;width: auto;" alt=""><br><br>
                    The presence of nitric oxide, NO, influences the rate of decomposition of ozone. Nitric oxide
                    acts as a catalyst in the following mechanism: <br>
                    <img src="/html/img/cre-10.6.png" style="height: 90px;width: auto;" alt=""><br><br>
                    The overall chemical change for the catalyzed mechanism is the same as: <br>
                    <img src="/html/img/cre-10.7.png" style="height: 30px;width: auto;" alt=""><br><br>
                    The nitric oxide reacts and is regenerated in these reactions. It is not permanently used up; thus,
                    it acts as a catalyst. The rate of decomposition of ozone is greater in the presence of nitric oxide
                    because of the catalytic activity of NO. Certain compounds that contain chlorine also catalyze
                    the decomposition of ozone. <br><br><br>
                    <i style="font-size: larger;">Heterogeneous Catalysts </i> <br><br>
                    A heterogeneous catalyst is a catalyst that is present in a different phase (usually a solid) than
                    the reactants. Such catalysts generally function by furnishing an active surface upon which a
                    reaction can occur. Gas and liquid phase reactions catalyzed by heterogeneous catalysts occur
                    on the surface of the catalyst rather than within the gas or liquid phase. <br><br>
                    Heterogeneous catalysis has at least four steps: <br><br>
                    1. Adsorption of the reactant onto the surface of the catalyst <br><br>
                    2. Activation of the adsorbed reactant <br>
                    3. Reaction of the adsorbed reactant <br><br>
                    4. Diffusion of the product from the surface into the gas or liquid phase (desorption). <br>
                    Any one of these steps may be slow and thus may serve as the rate determining step. In general,
                    however, in the presence of the catalyst, the overall rate of the reaction is faster than it would
                    be
                    if the reactants were in the gas or liquid phase. <br><br>
                    Figure 3 illustrates the steps that chemists believe to occur in the reaction of compounds
                    containing a carbon-carbon double bond with hydrogen on a nickel catalyst. Nickel is the
                    catalyst used in the hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fats and oils (which contain several
                    carbon-carbon double bonds) to produce saturated fats and oils (which contain only carbon-
                    carbon single bonds). <br><br>
                    <img src="/html/img/cre-10.3.png" style="height: 250px;width: auto;" alt=""><br><br>
                    Figure 3. There are four steps in the catalysis of the reaction C2H4+H2⟶C2H6 by
                    nickel. (a) Hydrogen is adsorbed on the surface, breaking the H-H bonds and forming
                    Ni-H bonds. (b) Ethylene is adsorbed on the surface, breaking the π-bond and forming
                    Ni-C bonds. (c) Atoms diffuse across the surface and form new C-H bonds when they
                    collide. (d) C2H6 molecules escape from the nickel surface, since they are not strongly
                    attracted to nickel. <br>
                </p><br>

                    <b>Conclusion -</b> <br><br>
                    Catalysts affect the rate of a chemical reaction by altering its mechanism to provide a
                    lower activation energy. Catalysts can be homogenous (in the same phase as the
                    reactants) or heterogeneous (a different phase than the reactants).
